<h2>Description of My Flower selling Website</h2>
<p>
The flower selling website is designed using HTML and CSS and is deployed on the Azure platform. The website showcases a wide variety of beautiful flowers available for purchase.
</p>

<p>
The homepage of the website features a visually appealing layout with a header displaying the company logo and navigation menu. The main content area displays a carousel of high-quality images showcasing different types of flowers. Below the carousel, there is a section highlighting the best-selling flowers and special offers.
</p>

<p>
The navigation menu consists of different categories of flowers, such as roses, lilies, orchids, and more. Clicking on a category takes the user to a dedicated page displaying all the available flowers in that category. Each flower is presented with an image, name, price, and a brief description.
</p>

<p>
The website also includes a search bar at the top for users to easily find specific flowers. Additionally, there is a shopping cart icon in the header that allows users to add flowers to their cart and proceed to the checkout page.
